    """A query that can be cancelled by closing its dedicated connection.

    Unlike queries run on the shared connection, this creates a dedicated
    connection for each query execution, allowing the query to be cancelled
    by simply closing the connection - which works across all database types.

    Usage:
        query = CancellableQuery(
            sql="SELECT * FROM large_table",
            config=connection_config,
            adapter=db_adapter,

        )

        # In main thread: start cancellable query
        future = executor.submit(query.execute, max_rows=1000)

        # To cancel from another thread:
        query.cancel()  # This closes the connection, aborting the query

    Attributes:
        sql: The SQL query to execute.
        config: Connection configuration for creating dedicated connection.
        adapter: Database adapter for connection and query execution.
        tunnel: Optional existing SSH tunnel to reuse.
