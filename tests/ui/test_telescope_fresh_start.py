"""UI test for telescope on fresh start (no active connection).

Regression tests:
1. _pending_telescope_query must be set before connecting so the
   post-connection callback can pick up the query.
2. When the connection config has no default database but the history
   query was run against a specific database, telescope should try to
   extract and apply the database context from the query.
