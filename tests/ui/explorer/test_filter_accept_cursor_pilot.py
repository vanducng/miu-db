"""Pilot-driven test for cursor position after accepting a filter match.

Runs the real Textual app + Tree widget via `app.run_test()` and presses
real keys. Asserts that pressing Enter on a filtered match leaves the
cursor on that match in the rebuilt tree (the failure mode the user
sees is that it lands somewhere else — e.g. the top node).
