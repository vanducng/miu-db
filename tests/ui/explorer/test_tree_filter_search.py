"""Tests for the explorer tree '/' search filter.

Simulates typing into the tree filter and pressing backspace to verify that
narrowing then widening the query restores previously-matching nodes.

Scenario:
1. Tree has many connection nodes; some contain 't' in their name.
2. Open filter and type 't' -> only 't'-matching nodes are visible.
3. Type 't' again (filter is 'tt'), which matches none -> tree becomes empty.
4. Press backspace (filter back to 't') -> 't'-matching nodes reappear.
