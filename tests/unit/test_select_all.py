"""Test for select_all functionality.

This test verifies that select_all_range returns correct coordinates.
The actual UI integration test (action_select_all with Textual Selection)
requires textual to be installed and is tested via integration tests.

Fix applied: action_select_all now uses textual.widgets.text_area.Selection
instead of a tuple, as Textual's TextArea requires a Selection object.
