"""Regression tests for process worker pickle safety (issue #161 follow-up).

Two layers of defence:

1. `CursorBasedAdapter.execute_query` sanitizes rows before returning, so
   `memoryview` (from psycopg2 bytea) becomes `bytes`. This is what PR #171
   landed. We pin that wiring here with a mock cursor, and check the
   sanitized output is picklable.

2. `_WorkerState.send` surfaces a pickle failure as an error message
   instead of silently dropping it — otherwise the client's `recv()`
   waits forever. Without this, any non-picklable cell type (not just
   bytea) would still hang the TUI.
